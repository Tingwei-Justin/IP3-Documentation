# FAQ

### What's the difference between authorization and license?

"Authorization" and "License" are related terms, but they have different meanings and implications.

* "Authorization" generally refers to the process of granting permission or the right to do something. It can also refer to the specific permission or right that has been granted.
* "License" on the other hand refers to a legally-binding agreement that allows an individual or organization to use a product, service, or intellectual property under specific conditions.

In summary, "Authorization" is more general, and "License" is more specific. A "License" is a type of "Authorization".

Here is an example:

* An artist creates a digital artwork and mints it as an NFT. They then authorize a specific individual or organization to sell the NFT on their behalf. This authorization would allow the individual or organization to list the NFT for sale on a marketplace.
* Once the NFT is sold to a buyer, the buyer would then be issued a license that allows them to display or use the artwork in specific ways. This license could be encoded in the NFT itself, and could specify things like whether the artwork can be resold, or how it can be used in other projects.

In this example, the "Authorization" is granted by the artist to the seller, allowing them to list the NFT for sale, while the "License" is granted to the buyer, allowing them to use the artwork in specific ways.

### What's the different between "time-based licensing" and "quantity-based licensing" in IP3?

In the context of IP licensing, "time-based licensing" and "quantity-based licensing" are terms used to describe different types of licensing arrangements.

"Time-based licensing" refers to a licensing arrangement where the user pays for a specific period of time, such as by the month, year or multiple years. This type of licensing is often used for software, music and other digital content, such as renting a software for a year.

"Quantity-based licensing" refers to a licensing arrangement where the user pays for a specific amount or quantity, such as by the unit or by the number of users. This type of licensing is often used for software, music and other digital content, such as renting a software for a specific number of users or for a specific number of devices.

Examples:

* Renting a software for a year is a time-based licensing.
* Renting music for a month is a time-based licensing
* Renting a software for a specific number of users is a quantity-based licensing.
* Renting music for a specific number of devices is a quantity-based licensing.
